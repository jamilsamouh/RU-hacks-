# What Language I used **jojo**
I used Python through Spyder Integrated Development Environment (IDE) using Keras and Tensorflow as backend 
# Description
This project was about taking a live picture of a banana and then calssify it to Yellow/Green/Rotten banana using convolutional neural network
while connecting it to an app which can predict when the farmer should pick the banana up before getting rotten and in a span of time that
the banana won't turn to rottern by the time it reaches the consumer and this was under RU Hackathon.
# What I learned 
understanding how does image processing works such as pooling/padding.. etc and how to implement it and it was challenging at beginning 
and exciting process and glad I got this opportunity to learn more about deep learning
